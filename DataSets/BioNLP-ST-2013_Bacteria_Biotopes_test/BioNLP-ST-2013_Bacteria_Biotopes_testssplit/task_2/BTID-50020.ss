Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus
Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus burrows into another microbe, killing it and using the remains to make offspring
Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus is a highly motile Gram-negative delta-proteobacterium that preys on other bacteria.
Bdellovibrio are ubiquitous in nature, having been discovered in a wide variety of environments that include both aquatic and terrestrial habitats as well as mammalian intestines.
Their prey includes plant, animal, and human pathogens
Despite the small dimensions of Bdellovibrio cells (0.2 to 0.5 Am wide and 0.5 to 2.5 Am long), its genome consists of 3,782,950 base pairs (bp) on a single circular chromosome
In attack phase, B. bacteriovorus swims at high speed using a single sheathed polar flagellum with a characteristic dampened filament waveform.
Once B. bacteriovorus has collided with a prey cell, it remains reversibly attached to it for a short "recognition" period , after which it becomes irreversibly anchored via the pole opposite the flagellum.
Before invasion of the prey cell can be achieved, B. bacteriovorus generates a small opening in the prey cell's outer membrane and peptidoglycan layer, which is ultimately resealed.
A mixture of hydrolytic enzymes is applied in a locally targeted manner that prevents excessive damage to the prey and counters diffusion
Upon entry into the prey periplasm, B. bacteriovorus sheds its flagellum and soon afterward it starts cellular events such as DNA replication and the synthesis of cellular biopolymer, it then alters the cell shape of its prey, forming a joint structure called the bdelloplast .
The previously rod-shaped prey becomes rounded by a process believed to involve the hydrolysis of peptide crosslinks and glycanase activity.
Studying the molecular mechanisms of Bdellovibrio's degradative enzymes gives insight into those targets in prey cells that have proven to be evolutionarily successful points of attack and offers the possibility for the design of antimicrobial agents
