Treponema denticola
Treponema denticola causes periodontal disease
Treponema denticola is an obligate anaerobe and is one of a number of spirochetes found in the oral cavity of humans. It is commonly associated with periodontal disease, an inflammation of gum tissue that frequently precedes bone resorbtion and subsequent tooth loss. The bacterial flora in gingival lesions produce a complex biofilm in which T. denticola and other treponemes form a prominent layer. With the decreased incidence of dental caries (cavities), periodontal disease has become a major concern in dentistry. It is estimated that 80% of adults in the U.S. have had periodontal disease at some time in their lives. T. denticola can invade gingival tissues and establish endodontic (tooth root canal) infections. T. denticola DNA and antigens have been detected in atherosclerotic lesions of the aorta in human patients. An association between preterm birth/low birth weight of infants and periodontal disease in the mother has also been described. Of veterinary importance, organisms closely related to T. denticola also cause digital dermatitis in cattle. Although T. denticola is related to T. pallidum, the syphilis spirochete, these organisms differ by more than 10%.
