Mycobacterium smegmatis

Also known by: Mycobacterium paratuberculosis smegmatis, Bacterium smegmatis, Bacillus smegmatis, Mycobacterium paratuberculosis smegmatis, Bacterium smegmatis, Bacillus smegmatis, Mycobacterium smegmatis (7).
Description and significance
Mycobacterium smegmatis was first discovered and isolated in 1884 by Lustgarten.
The name smegmatis was first given to Bacillus smegmatis by Trevisan in 1889.
Lehmann and Neumann gave the species name smegmatis to Mycobacterium smegmatis in 1899.
Mycobacterium smegmatis lives in aggregate layers of cells attached to each other in a community called a biofilm.
Mycobacterium smegmatis are mostly found in the soil, water, and plants.
They tend mostly to exist near large bodies of water.
Isolates have been discovered in 16 States, Australia, Russia, Canada, and Switzerland (1).
Mycobacterium smegmatis is classified as a saprophytic species that rarely causes disease and isn't dependent on living in an animal, unlike some pathogenic Mycobacterium.
The bacteria will be finely wrinkled and creamy white while it is growing on accessible nutrients.
When Mycobacterium smegmatis has been growing for quite some time and is abundant, the color will turn from white to a creamy yellow to pale orange.
It will also be waxy because of the high amount of unique Gram-positive cell wall coated with mycolic acids.
The bacteria also ranges in textures, being seen as smooth, flat and glistening or coarsely folded or finely wrinkled (12).
Mycobacterium smegmatis is very useful for the research analysis of other species in the genus Mycobacteria in cell culture laboratories.
There are several Mycobacterial species that are common, harmful diseases, like Mycobacterium leprea, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Mycobacterium bovis.
Mycobacterium smegmatis is so important because it is fast growing and non-pathogenic compared to these species.
There are many similarities between Mycobacterium smegmatis and the much more virulent obligate pathogens that are Mycobacteria.
The most significant is the complementary uses of mycothiol biosynthesis of Mycobacterium for making an essential thiol that is responsible for life.
If it is knocked out, the species will be terminated and a treatment will be found (10).
There is also research involved in finding drug therapies that will inhibit the myolic acid biosynthesis which is essential for creating the unique bacterial cell wall (11).
Currently, there are many laboratories that are culturing and isolating this species to determine the pathological course of deleterious Mycobacteria.

Ecology
Biofilms of Mycobacterium smegmatis may use stigmasterol as a carbon source from plants.
The bacteria will metabolize the compound to a potent androgen, androstenedione.
If Mycobacterium smegmatis is around a large body of water, which is where it usually exists, then the bacteria will secrete androstenedione.
The androgen in the water causes female mosquito fish to form male anatomical sex organs (15).
Not much else could be found about the contribution to the environment.
Pathology
This organism is classified as saprophytic and therefore relatively safe.
Mycobacterium smegmatis doesn't normally reside in any animals, and doesn't cause dangerous or even any infections.
There have only been a few threats, which have seem to come out in only extreme cases, however there hasn't been any documented virulence of Mycobacterium smegmatis in over 15 years.
There are many other species under this genus are pathogenic.
Obligate pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium bovis, and Mycobacterium leprea are highly pathogenic in animals.
These species can cause tuberculosis and leprosy, debilitating diseases that may lead to death or disfigurement.
These pathogens can only survive inside the host organism.
There is also the classification of potential pathogens in this genus, such as Mycobacterium avium, which may survive outside of the host environment and cause virulence once it is contracted by the host.
However, there has been 1 case where the bacteria has killed a human after infection.
In this case, an Italian child was infected by Mycobacterium smegmatis and died at the age of 8.
After genetic analysis of the child, it was determined that four nucleotides were inserted, causing a frameshift and a nonsense mutation.
The stop codon allowed for a premature stop of translation and essential proteins weren't made.
Although this showed potential pathogenic properties of Mycobacterium smegmatis, this case required that the child have two mutant alleles in his genome for the bacteria to be particularly virulent.
Therefore in most cases, Mycobacterium smegmatis is generally safe and not pathogenic (5).
Application to Biotechnology
Mycobacterium smegmatis has been used to produce Xylitol.
Xylitol is an important sugar that is used as a substitute for commercial dietary sugars to prevent tooth decay and reduce plaque.
It is also absorbed more slowly in the bloodstream, so it prevents the negative affects of high blood sugar levels.
This is used as a dietary alternative for diabetics.
It also has potential treatments for osteoporosis and ear and upper respiratory infections.
The D-xylulose sugar produced by Mycobacterium smegmatis is combined with the D-xylose sugar produced by D-xylose isomerase of immobilized Mycobacterium smegmatis to produce the beneficial Xylitol (6).
Mycobacterium smegmatis is also used to transform L-ribulose into L-arabinose with the enzyme L-arabinose isomerase.
Mycobacterium smegmatis produces L-arabinose during carbohydrate metabolism.
L-arabinose is used by biotech companies to produce chiral drugs.
Researchers use L-arabinose as a component for many tissue culture medium.
It is also used by food producers for the Maillard reaction to make bread, beer, dried or condensed milk, etc. (6).
