Helicobacter hepaticus
Helicobacter hepaticus causes chronic hepatitis and liver failure in mice
H. hepaticus is a motile Gram-negative , Microaerophilic organism 0.2 to 0.3 m in diameter, 1.5 to 5.0 m long, and curved to spiral in shape, with one to several spirals; it has bipolar sheathed flagella (one at each end) but lacks the periplasmic fibres that envelope the bacterial cells in other mouse Helicobacter species.
H. hepaticus has strong urease activity, is oxidase and catalase positive, produces H 2 S, reduces nitrate to nitrite, and grows microaerobically at 37 C but not at 25 C or 42 C.
H. hepaticus has a circular chromosome of 1,799,146 base pairs, Helicobacter hepaticus causes chronic hepatitis, liver cancer (hepatocarcinoma) and inflammatory bowel disease in mice.
The organism is most likely transmitted by fecal-oral route however the mode of liver invasion is unknown but the production of urease and a soluble hepatotoxic factor may be involved in the pathogenesis of H. hepaticus -induced liver lesions.
The importance of H. hepaticus to humans is not yet completely known.
Most Helicobacter species identified to date are characteristically associated with (and named after) specific mammalian host species where generally they inhabit the gastrointestinal tract (with or without causing gastritis or other chronic inflammatory disease), the potential host range for some species is quite broad.
H. pylori, originally isolated from humans, has recently been isolated also from the domestic cat; this raises the possibility that Helicobacter pylori may be a zoonotic pathogen that can be transmitted from companion animals to humans and also raises the possibilities that other Helicobacter species may be able to colonise other hosts.
The genomic variability of H. hepaticus was assessed by comparing the genomes of 12 H. hepaticus strains with the sequenced genome by microarray hybridization.
Although five strains, including all those known to have caused liver disease, were indistinguishable from ATCC51449, other strains lacked between 85 and 229 genes, including large parts of HHGI1, demonstrating extensive variation of genome content within the species.
