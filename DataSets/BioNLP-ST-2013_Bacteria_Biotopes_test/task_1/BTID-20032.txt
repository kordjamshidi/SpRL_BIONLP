Burkholderia cepacia AMMD

Burkholderia ambifaria AMMD [LMG 19182] is a rhizosphere organism effective in stimulating plant growth and suppressing soilborne plant pathogenic Pythium spp. and Aphanomyces euteiches. Its relevance to DOE is carbon sequestration.
Burkholderia ambifaria AMMD is the type strain for B. ambifaria, a species in the Burkholderia cepacia complex that includes soil saprophytes, plant commensals and human clinical isolates (Coenye et al., 2001). Burkholderia ambifaria AMMD was isolated by J. Parke in 1985 from the rhizosphere of pea ( Pisum sativum L.) near Arlington, Wisconsin, USA. When applied to pea or maize seeds, it colonizes the seed and root system. It suppresses seed rot and damping-off by plant pathogenic Pythium spp., and increases the yield of peas grown in soil infested with Aphanomyces euteiches (Bowers and Parke 1993; Heungens and Parke 2000, 2001; King and Parke 1993, 1996; Parke 1990; Parke et al 1991). Its use as an augmentative biological control agent was patented but never commercialized because of concerns about risks to human health (Parke and Gurian-Sherman, 2001).
