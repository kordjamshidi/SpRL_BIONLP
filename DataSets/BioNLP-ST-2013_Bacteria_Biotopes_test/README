Contents
--------

The sub-directories `task_1', `task_2' and `task_3' contains the documents and annotations for training for the sub-tasks 1, 2 and 3 respectively. The test data set for tasks 1 and 3 contains 27 documents, the test data set for task 2 contains 26 documents.

In each directory `*.txt' files contain the target text, each newline denotes a paragraph break.

In the directory `task_2', `*.a1' files contain bacteria, habitat and geographical/organization entities. In the test phase, only `*.a1' files will be provided: participating predictions must detect relations for given entities. The coreferences, represented as `Equiv' annotations are not provided in the test phase, nor they are expected to be predicted; they will be used by task organizers during the evaluation of predictions.
