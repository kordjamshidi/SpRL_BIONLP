Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis
Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis metabolizes sugars as the principal source of energy
Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis is a rod-shaped, Gram-negative , anaerobic eubacterium that was isolated from a freshwater hot spring in Tengchong, China. Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis, grows optimally at 80 degrees Celsius and metabolizes sugars as the principal source of energy and carbon source, and gains energy anaerobically by sulfur respiration. More than half the T. tengcongensis genes are 'extremely similar' to those of Bacillus halodurans
