Candidatus Blochmannia pennsylvanicus
Candidatus Blochmannia pennsylvanicus is an endosymbiont of Camponotus pennsylvanicus, (Carpenter Ant)
Millions of years ago, free living bacteria developed a close intracellular relationship with several species of insects, such as carpenter ants, aphids, tsetse flies, and many others.
No one knows quite how the bacteria started living inside the insect cells, but once they were established there, they quickly made themselves indispensable.
The bacteria are housed within the insect in specialised cells called bacteriocytes, and they aid the host by providing services specially adapted for the relationship.
For example, many species of insects rely on their bacterial symbionts for the production of essential nutrients that the insect is not capable of making on its own and cannot obtain from its diet
In turn, the bacteria have become completely dependent on their insect hosts and are no longer capable of surviving outside the host cell.
As the bacteria have adapted to these relationships, known as obligate symbiosis, they have evolved highly streamlined genomes that are specialized to provide the host-beneficial functions necessary to support their symbiotic lifestyle
The distinct lifestyle of obligately intracellular bacteria can alter fundamental forces that drive and constrain genome change.
The sequencing of the 792-kb genome of Blochmannia pennsylvanicus, an obligate endosymbiont of Camponotus pennsylvanicus, has enabled researchers to trace evolutionary changes that have occurred in the context of a bacterial-ant association.
