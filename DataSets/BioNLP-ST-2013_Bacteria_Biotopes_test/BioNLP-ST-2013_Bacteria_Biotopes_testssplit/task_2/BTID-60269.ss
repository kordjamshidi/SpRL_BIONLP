Granulibacter bethesdensis




Cell structure and metabolism
Granulibacter bethesdensis is usually found in soil and plants, and rarely in human.
It produces weak acetic acid by oxidizing glucose and ethanol but can't oxidize lactose, mannitol, sucrose, maltose or xylose (1);It oxidizes lactate and acetate to carbon dioxide and water, and uses methanol as a sole carbon source.
There are two major fatty acids: 1) a straight-chain unsaturated acid, 50% of total cellular fatty acid 2)C16:0, 17% of total cellular fatty acid (1).
Granulibacter bethesdensis produces acetic acid better with a lower concentration of CaCO3 in ethanol-CaCO3 agar plates (1).
Ecology
Contributions of Granulibacter bethesdensis have not been studied thoroughly.
Like many other organisms in Acetobacteraceae family, Granulibacter bethesdensis is a ubiquitous environmental organism, and causes biodegradation of organic waste.
Many organisms in Acetobacteraceae family are found in soil and associated with plants, and Asaia bogorensis is the only known organism that causes human disease in this family other than Granulibacter bethesdensis (4).
Granulibacter bethesdensis is able to break down ethanol, methanol and formaldehyde to produce non-toxic products, such as carbon dioxide, water and weak acetic acid (1,2).
Pathology
The discovery of the mechanisms about how Granulibacter bethesdensis causes chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) needs further research investigations.
CGD is caused by a defect in any of the 4 subunits of the NADPH oxidase, which affects the ability of phagocytes to generate antimicrobial reactive oxygen intermediates (5).
It is thought that catalase-positive pathogens causes CGD by depriving the CGD phagocytes of the oxidative metabolites to use against them (2,5,6).
However, the narrow list of catalase-positive bacteria that cause CGD suggest that there might be other mechanism beyond catalase (2).
Recent research showed that Granulibacter bethesdensis has low virulence and is not fatal;it causes fever, plympahdenitis, and weight loss over almost six months in a patient with X-linked CGD (2).
Application to Biotechnology
The ability of Granulibacter bethesdensis to oxidize ethanol and glucose to produce weak acetic acid in the presence of air may be exploited in vinegar production and wine fermentation (2).
It may be used as microbial fuel cell, and production of purified polypeptide enzymes for industrial use.
Current Research
One of the current main researches is to study the epidemiology and pathogenicity of Granulibacter bethesdensis (2).
Granulibacter bethesdensis genome sequence contributed to predicting relatedness to other bacteria (7).
Some scientists proposed the studies of the high-level resistance of Granulibacter bethesdensis to many antibiotics, and find out if the resistance is intrinsic of the bacteria or induced by antibiotic therapies (4).
