Thermobifida fusca
Thermobifida fusca is able to biodegrade plant cell walls
Thermobifida fusca, previously named Thermomonaspora fusca is a moderate thermophilic soil bacterium that grow optimally at 55C and has a broad pH range (4-10). It is a major degrader of plant cell walls in heated organic materials such as compost heaps, rotting hay, manure piles or mushroom growth medium. It appears to degrade all major plant cell wall polymers except lignin and pectin and can grow on most simple sugars and carboxylic acids. It is an actinomycete and its extracellular enzymes, including cellulases, have been studied extensively because of their thermostability, and high activity. Thermobifida fusca produces spores that can be allergenic and causes a condition called farmers lung (extrinsic allergic alveolitis).
