Thermosipho africanus TCF52B
Description
Thermosipho africanus.
Thermosipho africanus, a member of the Thermotogales, has the characteristic morphology of one or more cells contained in a sheath-like envelope which extends beyond the cell wall.
Preliminary sequencing of Thermotogales genomes has identified extensive horizontal gene transfer between these organisms and the Archaea.
Thermosipho africanus has been isolated from marine hydrothermal systems and oil reservoir production waters.
