Bifidobacterium adolescentis ATCC 15703
Description
Bifidobacterium adolescentis. This species is a normal inhabitant of the healthy human gut. Newborns, especially those that are breast-fed, are colonized with Bifidobacteria within days after birth. This species was first isolated from the feces of a breast-fed infant. The population of these bacteria in the colon appears to be relatively stable until late adulthood when it appears to decline. In one comprehensive 16S rDNA sequence-based enumeration of the colonic microbiota of three healthy adult humans it represents, on average, 0.008% of all 16S rDNA sequences and 4.302% of the sequences in its division (Eckburg et. al. (2005)). The bifidobacteria population is influenced by a number of factors, including diet, antibiotics and stress. Their name is derived from the observation that they often exist in a Y-shaped or bifid form. They are saccharolytic organisms that produce acetic and lactic acids without generation of CO2, except during degradation of gluconate.
