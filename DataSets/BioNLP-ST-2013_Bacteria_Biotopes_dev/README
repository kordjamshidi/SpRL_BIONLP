Development Data for BioNLP'13 Shared Task on Event Extraction -- Bacteria Biotopes tasks


- Contains 26 documents with manual annotations of entities, entity attribution to OntoBiotope concepts, localization and coreference relations

- For format details, please refer to the following address:

Contents
--------

The sub-directories `task_1', `task_2' and `task_3' contains the documents and annotations for development for the sub-tasks 1, 2 and 3 respectively.

In each directory `*.txt' files contain the target text, each newline denotes a paragraph break.

In the directory `task_1', `*.a2' files contain habitat entity annotations and their categorizations. These files will not be provided in the test phase: participating predictions must detect entity boundaries and categorizations. The categorization is a reference to a concept in the OntoBiotope ontology. This ontology can be downloaded in OBO format at the following address: http://bibliome.jouy.inra.fr/MEM-OntoBiotope/downloads.html

In the directory `task_2', `*.a1' files contain bacteria, habitat and geographical/organization entities. `*.a2' files contain localization and part-of relations and coreference groups. In the test phase, only `*.a1' files will be provided: participating predictions must detect relations for given entities. The coreferences, represented as `Equiv' annotations are not provided in the test phase, nor they are expected to be predicted; they will be used by task organizers during the evaluation of predictions.

In the directory `task_3', `*.a2' files contain bacteria, habitat and geographical/organization entities, as well as localization and part-of relations and coreference groups. In the test phase, only the text will be provided: participating predictions must detect entity boundaries and relations.
