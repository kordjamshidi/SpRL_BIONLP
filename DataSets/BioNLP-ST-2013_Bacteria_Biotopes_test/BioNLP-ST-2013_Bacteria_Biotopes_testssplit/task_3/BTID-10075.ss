Baumannia cicadellinicola str.
Hc (Homalodisca coagulata) Hc
Description
Baumannia cicadellinicola.
This newly discovered organism is an obligate endosymbiont of the leafhopper insect Homalodisca coagulata (Say), also known as the Glassy-Winged Sharpshooter, which feeds on the xylem of plants.
The insect causes devastation to grape crops and may affect other grasses as it is a vector for the bacterial pathogen, Xylella fastidiosa, which can cause disease in grapevines.
The bacterium is found within bacteriomes, specialized organs in the insect, and they are transmitted vertically from female to offspring.
This bacterium is found within a red-pigmented bacteriome within the host.
The bacteria-insect relationship is one of nutritional co-dependence: the bacteria provide important metabolites for the insect's nutritional requirements, and in turn receive a safe environment and metabolites from the insect.
It is suspected that this genome will have undergone massive reduction, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis suggests the genome size is only 671 kb.
Presumably, the genes that have been retained will strongly reflect the nutritional co-dependence requirements of the bacterium and the host.
