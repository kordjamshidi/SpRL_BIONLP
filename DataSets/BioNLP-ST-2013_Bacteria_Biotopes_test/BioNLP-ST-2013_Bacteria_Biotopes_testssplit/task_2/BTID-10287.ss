Frankia sp. EAN1pec
Description
Frankia. This genus is a member of the actinomycetales and forms a symbiotic nitrogen-fixing association with a number of plants.
Vesicles, which are spherically differentiated structures, are formed inside of the plant cell and are the sites of bacterial nitrogen fixation.
The genus is named after the Swiss microbiologist, A.B.
Frank, and was originally thought to be a fungus due to the extremely hyphal morphology of the organism.
Description

This strain was isolated at the Kettering Research Laboratory in Ohio by M. Lalonde in 1978.
