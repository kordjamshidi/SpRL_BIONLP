Streptococcus thermophilus LMG 18311

Description
Streptococcus thermophilus.
This organism is a lactic acid bacteria often used as a starter culture for fermented dairy products including yogurt and cheese.
At the same time this dairy species is phylogenetically close to pathogenic streptococci, evoking the possibility that it has a virulence potential.
The genome sequences and analysis of two yogurt strains of S. thermophilus will be reported in the paper.
Description
Streptococcus thermophilus strain LMG 18311.
This strain was isolated from commercial yogurt in 1974 in the United Kingdom and is easily manipulated genetically.
