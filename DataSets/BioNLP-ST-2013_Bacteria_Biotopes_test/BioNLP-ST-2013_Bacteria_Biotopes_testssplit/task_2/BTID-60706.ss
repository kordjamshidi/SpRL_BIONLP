Description and Significance
Wolbachia pipientis are bacteria that infect a wide range of invertebrate, mainly arthropods and numerous insects.
Wolbachia is one of the most common pathogens on Earth that infect the reproductive system of insects; it is estimated that more than 18% of insects are infected by it including spider, mosquito, and flies.
The bacteria give various physical characteristics of its infection that cause a variety of result including deterring chromosomal sex determination from gamete fertilization.
Also, it may initiate parthenogenesis that causes growth and development without fertilization by sperm because it can selectively kill males; thus, it creates a detrimental competition against sperm and causes cytoplasmic incompatibility in fertilized eggs.
Wolbachia's uniqueness in altering reproduction has caused many scientists to research the biology of infection and their potential use for controlling pest and pathosis.

Ecology
Based on many studies, the evidence of vertical gene transfer in their hosts by Wolbachia is apparent.
However, there's no proof that supports any lateral gene transfer between Wolbachia and D. melanogaster or between Wolbachia and any other hosts.
Furthermore, evolutionary evidence shows that mitochondria share a common ancestor with alpha-Proteobacteria, but has no evidence for similarity with mitochondria with species in the order of Rickettsiales.
Pathology
Wolbachia is a parasitic bacteria that infects reproductive system of insects which ultimately affects their linage continuation.
The symbiosis between the bacteria and host is complex.
Depending on the interaction, it ranges from mutualism to parasitism.
The bacteria infect different types of organ, but the remarkable characteristic is their ability to alter the way maternal genes are passed on to the next generation by infecting the testes and ovaries of their hosts.
There are four different phenotypes expressed:
Furthermore, Wolbachia are not found in mature sperms, but are found in mature eggs.
So, the infection is carried along to offspring by infected females but not males.
